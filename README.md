# TextureMappingRenderer
My implementation of Texture Mapping as part of a Rendering Project for the course DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction in KTH. A link to the project blog can be found [here](https://texturemaprenderer.wordpress.com/)

To use this project using Visual Studio 2019, you will have to add the include directories of [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) (OpenGL Version 3.3, Core Profile), [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm). Additionally it requires adding the library directories of SDL2.
